# Synseer

Synseer (Syntax Seer) is a tool for helping students learn to parse Ruby syntax.
This is especially difficult for students who have never programmed before,
and it prevents them from being able to think about the higher ideas,
such as code structure, or what the code is doing.

The goal is not to understand everything they see,
it is purely to develop the mechanical ability of
looking at code and syntactically knowing what it is.
If you then want them to understand something like
the significance of a local variable vs an instance variable,
well, you'll have to teach them the object model
(which I also have a lot of material for).
